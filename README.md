# WebApp

This is a repository for practices on creating simple webapp using Go language

The web app will be improved in the future to monitor a directory in Windows 10 if there is any new files in the directory,
It will sync the new files to Google cloud storage. 

After the implementation, it should be able to run as a docker container.

Directory is to be checked every 10 mins for new files.
